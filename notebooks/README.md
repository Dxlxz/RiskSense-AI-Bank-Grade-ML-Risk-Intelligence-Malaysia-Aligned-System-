# RiskSense AI - Notebooks

This directory contains experimentation and analysis notebooks.

## Notebooks

| Notebook | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `01_eda_snapshot.ipynb` | Exploratory data analysis |
| `02_model_prototype.ipynb` | Model development and iteration |
| `03_drift_analysis.ipynb` | Drift detection and monitoring analysis |

## Guidelines

1. **Notebooks are for exploration**, not production code
2. Once an approach is validated, refactor into `src/` modules
3. Keep notebooks clean and documented
4. Clear outputs before committing

## Creating Notebooks

```bash
# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

Or use VS Code with the Jupyter extension.
